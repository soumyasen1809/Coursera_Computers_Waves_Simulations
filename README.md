Computers, Waves, Simulations: A Practical Introduction to Numerical Methods using Python

This course provides a basic introduction how to apply methods like the finite-difference method, the pseudospectral method, the linear and spectral element method to the 1D (or 2D) scalar wave equation. The mathematical derivation of the computational algorithm is accompanied by python codes embedded in Jupyter notebooks. In a unique setup one can see how the mathematical equations are transformed to a computer code and the results visualized. The emphasis is on illustrating the fundamental mathematical ingredients of the various numerical methods (e.g., Taylor series, differentiation, function interpolation, numerical integration) and how they compare.

Python version 2.7 has been used for the development process.
